						<h3>Our Vision</h3>
			
						<p>After you have navigated through our website, you will have a greater understanding of Morgan silver dollars. You should be able to identify key dates, quality, authenticity, and many more facts. As this was just a form of currency when it was originally created, people thought nothing of it at the time. As the United States converted from the silver standard, where the money produced was backed by precious metals, people began to hoard coins produced before 1964. While coins that are produced today do not have much value behind the metal, coins of the previous era did.</p>

						<h3>Who am I?</h3>
		
						<p>I am Frank Smith, and I have been collecting coins off and on since I was 9 years old. I have built an extensive collection of not just Morgan dollars, but also Lincoln cents, Liberty Head and Roosevelt dimes, and many others. From collecting precious metals, to enjoying the history, each coin has a story. While it is impossible to know who has held each coin, it is interesting to think who has and where it has been. </p>
				
						<h3>Why Did I Create This Site?</h3>
						<p>To teach others about Morgan dollars, so that this hobby is not as obscure as it has been. This site will explore Morgan dollars in greater depth, and provide a greater understanding of how they were produced, why they are collected, and how rare some are compared to others.</p>
