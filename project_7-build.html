					<h1>Cleaning</h1> 
					<p>Want to make your coins clean, and look like new? Be extremely careful with the option you choose, because the wrong choice can ruin your coin. You never want to use an abrasive cleaner or pad, because it will scratch the surface and/or remove the surface layer of the coin.</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- water -->

				<div id="cleaningoption1" class="grid_8">
					<h2>Water</h2> 
					<p>As it is the simplest choice, it is also the safest option. Simply run the coins under tap water, avoiding any corrosive chemicals. For debris that has hardened onto the surface, let the coin soak until loose. Do not scratch at the spot, because this could leave damage on the coins surface. If distilled water is available, please consider using this over tap water, as it, too, may contain unknown chemicals that may adhere to the coins surface.</p>

				<!-- soap -->

				<div id="cleaningoption2" class="grid_8"> 
					<h2>Soap</h2>
					<p>Using soap has the potential of damaging your coin, so choose the soap very carefully. Make sure that it is not abrasive, and does not contain any corrosive agents. Use a small amount of dish soap, in preferably distilled water. If distilled water is not an option, tap water is acceptable. Once you have made your solution in a bowl, carefully rub the surface of the coin. This is the risk of this method, as it has the potential of scratching the coinâ€™s surface. Be gentle, and never scrub! </p>
				</div>
		
				<!-- extra -->

				<div id="cleaningoption3" class="grid_8"> 
					<h2>Extra Options</h2>
					<p>While there are more extreme options, they are not generally recommended and will not be covered on this website in greater detail. These options can involve abrasive and corrosive materials, that will make the coins look their best, but these options will ruin the value of the coin the moment you use any of them. Pencil erasers, tomato ketchup, vinegar, salt, lemon juice, baking soda, and many other options are available. Please be careful, and do not use these on valuable coins! </p>
