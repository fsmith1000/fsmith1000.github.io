					<h1><ins>Grading</ins></h1>
			
					<p>The grade of your coin is one of the most important aspects for your collection. You will always strive to have the best grade possible for your collection; however, with some rare coins, you will just be happy with the lowest quality. No matter if you are a beginner or an expert, it is always helpful to check a chart as you grade your coins. While I cannot guarantee these grades are 100% accurate, they are the closest approximations that I can offer. </p>
			
					<dl>
						<dt>Poor - P1</dt>
							<dd id="gradepoor"></dd>
							<dd>This is the lowest grade possible, just showing the outline of the image from the coin with the date visible.</dd>
						<dt class="page1">Fair - FR2</dt>
							<dd>The image is more defined, but still very worn and unpleasing to the eye.</dd>
						<dt>About Good - AG3</dt>
							<dd>More definition is visible, with the wear focused around the raised and outer section of the coin.</dd>
						<dt>Good - G4 &amp; G6</dt>
							<dd id="gradeg"></dd>
							<dd>Much more definition, with visible words and slight definition in the hair.</dd>
						<dt class="page2">Very Good - VG8 &amp; VG10</dt>
							<dd id="gradevg"></dd>
							<dd>The coin will have a lot of detail, with more wear on the highest points of the coin.</dd>
						<dt>Fine - F12 &amp; F15</dt>
							<dd id="gradefine"></dd>
							<dd>Defined detail throughout the coin, with moderate wear on the highest points of the coin.</dd>
						<dt class="page3">Very Fine - VF20 &amp; VF35</dt>
							<dd id="gradevf"></dd>
							<dd>Considerable detail is visible, with definition becoming visible on the crown and hair.</dd>
						<dt>Extremely Fine - EF40 &amp; EF45</dt>
							<dd id="gradeef"></dd>
							<dd>Very light wear, mainly visible on the temples of the hair, and breast of the eagle.</dd>
						<dt class="page4">Almost Uncirculated - AU50, AU53, AU58 &amp; AU58</dt>
							<dd id="gradeau"></dd>
							<dd>Almost no wear, with only slight scratches or blemishes visible on the coin.</dd>
						<dt>Mint State - MS60-MS64</dt>
							<dd id="gradems"></dd>
							<dd>No wear is visible, with only light scratches from transportation.</dd>
						<dt>Mint State - MS65-MS69</dt>
							<dd>Near flawless, with only the slightest scratches from transportation.</dd>

					<p>Hopefully you now have a better understanding on how to grade your own coins, but do not forget to take into account the tarnishing of the coin. While some versions add a nice color to the coin, some may do the exact opposite. It is best to look for the cleanest looking coin, slight hue from tarnish is ok, but be careful of overly clean looking coins. If the coin has been cleaned, the value will be negatively affected.</p>
