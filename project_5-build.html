			<h2>Silver Price Calculator</h2> 
			<p>We have written a tool below for you to do a quick price check on your coins, and it will allow you to enter how many coins you have saved. It will display the estimated melt value of your silver content. Please be aware that prices listed on this page are not a direct representation of the price you may receive, and they should not be used as such. </p>

			<p>As many of the collectors know, they are investing in silver as well as history when they purchase Morgan silver dollars. When the 1965 bill was passed removing most of the silver from United States minted coins, the citizens began taking a lot of the silver coins out of circulation in an effort to hold onto a valuable metal that was drastically rising in price. Each Morgan silver dollar is equivalent to 1 troy ounce of silver, and they hold 90% silver in each coin. This is one of the main reasons silver collectors like these coins. Each coin can be easily calculated, unlike nickels which held 35% silver between 1866-1942. Silver quarters contained 90% silver between 1932-1964, and it takes 5.5 quarters per ounce. Those who melt the coins down are essentially cashing in on their metal value, and destroying history in the process. Silver is a rare metal, but it is much less rare then gold and platinum. Silver is found with gold and other minerals, which requires the use of amalgamation or electrolysis to separate the different components. It has been used for minting coins since as early as 4,000 BC, and most of the world used it for currency until modern times. As there have been billions of ounces produced throughout human existence, much of it still lies underground. Mexico in 2014 alone, produced 161,000,000 ounces, not to mention the rest of the worlds production. </p>

			<p>The silver price fluctuates often as it often follows stock markets. When stock prices fall, silver and gold prices will rise. As of this writing on &quot;5/11/2017&quot; the price was &quot;$16.33&quot;.</p>
