						<p>Games have always been an intricate part of most people’s childhood, and what better game can you think of than when you played rock, paper, scissors as a child? Then let's play a game where rock is &quot;penny&quot;, paper is &quot;cloth&quot;, and scissors is &quot;morgan&quot;. While the names aren’t the best, it is still a great game that we hope you will enjoy.</p>
					</div>
	
					<div id="gamehistory" class="grid_8">
						<p>According to Wikipedia, the game &quot;Rock&quot;, &quot;Paper&quot;, and &quot;Scissors&quot; was first mentioned in the book &quot;Wuzazu&quot; written in 1600 (Ming-dynasty). The writer, Xie Zhaozhi described that it originated as early as 206 B.C. during the Han-dynasty. It was originally named &quot;mushi-ken&quot; from China, and it was imported into Japanese as &quot;sansukumi-ken&quot;. Both versions used finger representations of animals, while modern day society has diverted away from these representations. In our case, we have changed the terms to suit our needs, where &quot;penny&quot; stands for a small yet strong force, &quot;cloth&quot; holds power in in flimsiness, and &quot;morgan&quot; is strong and massive. All have the ability to win, sharing the same strength as each other, while all in a different and subtle way. As both Japan and China utilized different animals, each animal that was used, represented their cultures supernatural superstitions for the animal chosen.</p>
					</div>
	
					<div id="gamespread" class="grid_8">
						<p>As the game grew in popularity, it began to spread across the world. Leaving Asia, a club was created in England in 1842. The Paper Scissors Stone Club, which was later changed in 1918 to &quot;World RPS Club&quot;, moved its headquarters to Toronto, Canada in 1925. They even had a championship!</p>
					</div>
	
					<div id="gamewins" class="grid_8">
						<p>While it is impossible to have an edge over a truly random opponent, newer players are easily exploited for repetition. As most children find out, people alternate in a repetitious manner when the opponent makes a move. The more experienced players will use this to their advantage. This makes the game less random, and easier to win for the advanced player.</p>
