						<h1>Value</h1> 
						<p>As you will quickly become aware, there will be a drastic difference in the price from one coin to another. This can be affected by a number of factors, such as &quot;Mintage&quot;, &quot;Quantity&quot;, &quot;Grade&quot;, and &quot;Weathering&quot;. </p>
					</div>
	
					<!-- mintage -->

					<div id="pricingmintage" class="grid_6">
						<h2>Mintage:</h2> 
						<p>While there are multiple mintage locations each year, the mintage at each location is different from year to year. When this occurs, the lower amount that makes it to the public will directly affect the collector value. When you have millions of one date and mintmark, the value will be lower than one that only produced a couple of hundred thousand coins. This is mainly why you will not find many &quot;CC&quot; coins for under $100 in the worst condition.</p>

					<div id="pricingremaining" class="grid_8"> 
						<h3>Quantity:</h3>
						<p>When silver value becomes extremely high, more and more Morgan silver dollars (silver coins in general) are melted down for their silver content. This will decrease the number of available dates and mintmark; therefor, driving the value of that year and mintmark up. As more years pass since the original date, less coins will be available as they will become lost or destroyed, making them rarer in the process.</p>
					</div>
	
					<!-- condition -->
	
					<div id="pricinggrade" class="grid_7">
						<h3>Grade:</h3>
						<p>While there may be a high mintage, only a few examples may be a superiorly high quality grade. Coins in these higher grades will always be worth more, and sought after by collectors. As only a few of these examples are present with each mintage, and on the occasion the annual mintage is low, the price that can be fetched for these coins can be astronomical.</p> 
					</div>
		
					<!-- weathering -->
	
					<div id="pricingweathering" class="grid_7">
						<h3>Weathering:</h3>
						<p>Weathering on the coin can be a good thing in some cases, and in others, it can hurt the value. The luster that can be cast on the coin can make it look different, and beautiful. This occurs through the oxidation process, which naturally occurs with silver coins. The negative impact can be seen when the coin turns extremely dark, essentially removing the distinguishing factors on the coin. It has the potential of lowering the desirability of the coin, depending on the extent.</p>
