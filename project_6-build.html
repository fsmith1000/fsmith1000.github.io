						<h1>History</h1> 
						<p>Many people who look at Morgan silver dollars don't actually know the history behind the coin, and just simply refer to them as silver dollars. While this is a partly true statement, if you feel that you do not know the entire story behind one of the most beautiful coins in United States history, please read more below!</p>

					<!-- creator -->

					<div id="historycreator" class="grid_9">
						<h2>Creator</h2> 
						<p>The visionary behind Morgan silver dollars was George T. Morgan. He engraved both sides of the coin, cementing his name in history. As one of the most prolific coins, silver and coin collectors have amassed hoards of these coins, helping protect them for future generations. While some will melt the coins for silver content, millions of other coins will still be available, simply making the rarer dates harder to find. This coin was produced for only 25 years, but it also lasted in circulation for many years after.</p>

						<h3>Minting</h3>
						<p>Minting occurred across the country in four different locations. Carson City (CC), Denver (D), New Orleans (O), and San Francisco. Each location produced different amounts of Morgan dollars each year. This fluctuation raised and lowered the price of the collector value, since some dates were harder to find than others. Low mintage, along with high grade coins, make coins worth upwards of $100,000.00, with less rare coins with $30-40.</p>

					<!-- errors -->

					<div id="historyerrors" class="grid_8"> 
						<h3>Errors</h3>
						<p>There have been many error versions of coins that have been distributed to the population, and these coins are highly sought after. While small marks on the coin die will allow the slab of silver to imprint higher than it should, others may become stuck while printing and be struck multiple times. The higher the distortion to the coin will make it rarer, as the mint generally catches most of these errors before they are released to the public. The type that is most likely going to make it through to the public are rotated dies, and off center strikes. The values that are associated with these errors range dramatically, as they are unique to each coin, and the desirability of the coin to the public.  </p>
