				<!-- Uses -->

				<div id="directionTop" class="grid_8">
					<h2>Uses</h2> 
					<p>If this site were to become a website, I would envision a store section, where users could buy coins, and possibly a blogging section where users can communicate with one another. This site would have potential of being used as a possible company website, it would just need some tweaking, because of the inconsistencies for coloring, fonts, and background due to requirements for the project.</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- My Website -->
	
				<div id="directionMiddle" class="grid_8">
					<h2>My Website</h2>
					<p>This website will be included on my <a href="https://www.franksmith.org">franksmith.org</a> website, which I intend to build over the Summer. This project will be modified, and listed through a set of links to this and other projects that I plan to build and/or upload. This website will be hosted on GitHub, since I do not have a personal server running 24/7 in my house.</p>

				<!-- Not Used -->

				<div id="directionBottom" class="grid_8"> 
					<h3>Not Used:</h3>
					<p>As I do not plan on selling coins, this project will be used to show to potential employers exactly what I am capable of developing. This course has provided me a vast amount of skills that I have wanted to develop, and do plan on creating more so in the future. </p>
				</div>
		
				<!-- Javascript -->

				<div id="directionBottom2" class="grid_8"> 
					<h3>JavaScript:</h3>
					<p>JavaScript has been one of the best, most challenging, and thought provoking areas that I have had with this course. Thinking through all outcomes is mind bogglingly difficult, and in some areas you need to settle for almost perfect. I am planning on exploring it more over the Summer, since I see a lot of potential that it, and JQUERY, can provide.</p>
				</div>
		
				<div id="directionThankYou" class="grid_8"> 
					<h2>Thank You:</h2>
					<p>Thank you for a great course! It has helped me gain a better understanding of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and JQUERY.</p>
