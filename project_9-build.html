				<h1>Storage</h1> 
				<p>We will go through the best options for storing your Morgan silver dollars, helping provide stability and protection for your coins. With improper care, you will hurt your coins value immensely. We will cover coin albums, folders, and tubes.</p>

			<!-- never -->

			<div id="storagenever" class="grid_4">

				<p>Never store your coins in:</p>
					<ul> 
						<li>High Heat</li> 
						<li>Extreme Cold</li>
						<li>Humid Environment</li> 
						<li>Loose, or in a bucket</li>
					</ul>

			<div id="storagealbum" class="grid_8">
				<h2>Sealed Album:</h2> 
				<p>Our personal favorite is a collectable coin album. With this option, your holder will have proper size indents to provide stability to the coin, while a plastic cover protects your coins from the environment. This option is highly recommended, as it offers the most protection, and the easiest way to display your coins. It looks like an ordinary book, allowing you to stack them on top of one another, providing an elegant design to your collection. It is also great for showing children, as they will not be able to damage your coins, or swallow them since they are encased in the album. </p>
			</div>
		
			<!-- option 2 -->

			<div id="storagefolders" class="grid_8"> 
				<h3>Folders:</h3>
				<p>Our second favorite, but not preferred method, is a coin folder. With this option, your coins will fit somewhat securely in the provided indents, but they do have the chance of falling out occasionally. The reverse side of the coin is never visible, and the front of the coin is exposed to the environment, and also risks scratches and dents to the coin. For this reason, along with no protection from the environment, we do not utilize this for our collections. This is the riskiest version we will discuss on this website for children, as they can easily pry the coins out, and put them in their mouth. Please never leave children alone with this option. Use this at your own risk!</p>

			<div id="storagetubes" class="grid_8">
				<h3>Tubes:</h3>
				<p>Sealed coin tubes - preferably plastic to block oxidization of the coins. This is the best option for storing the coins you will not display, or for the dates you want to protect from the environment. It is a very basic and cheap option, that will add extra protection than you would find with other options non collectors would utilize.</p>
